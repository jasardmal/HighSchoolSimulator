intended to simulate high school life from freshman to senior year.

directory is set to where the respository was cloned (Note: While working on the project, it helps to make sure Github is up-to-date
which can be checked by clicking the gear in the upper-right hand corner of the Github app and navigating to "About Github Desktop.").
